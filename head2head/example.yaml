'''
This file is an example of a head2head configuration file.
The head2head configuration file is used to compare the performance of agents in a head-to-head manner.
The configuration file is a YAML file that contains the following fields:

- game: The name of the game that the agents are playing.
- agents: A list of agents that are being compared.
  - path: The path to the agent file. 
          for the game theoretic algos, the path should be a .pkl file, 
          for the deep learning algos, the path should be a .pth file
  - algo: The name of the algorithm that the agent was trained with.
